Business Justification: Why This Decision Tree Engine Matters

In the iGaming industry, personalization, speed, and retention are king. Players churn fast. Offers must be timely. Operations and marketing teams need to automate engagement workflows — without waiting for backend deployments.

SmartFlow Core solves this with a real-time, extensible decision tree engine that:

Executes logic based on live player data

Supports non-engineering users through JSON-configurable rules

Provides a foundation for marketing automation and compliance workflows

Core Problem

Marketing wants to automate: "If user hasn’t played in 5 days, send SMS"

Engineering wants to avoid custom if/else logic in backend services

Product wants traceability and speed

The Solution

Define trees as JSON: dynamic, human-readable, no code deployment required

Evaluate trees in under 200ms

Trigger actions like:

Send SMS

Send Email

Grant Bonus

Branch logic with Condition

Repeat logic with Loop

Persona Example: Maria, a VIP Player

Maria hasn’t played in 5 days

Her profile is evaluated in real time:

If Gold Tier → send VIP SMS

If Silver Tier → email upgrade offer

Logic is versioned, editable, and defined in JSON

No redeploys required to update the flow

Logs and results are traceable for auditing

Business Benefits

Fast time to market for campaigns

Logic can be updated by product or marketing

No risk of introducing bugs into core backend

Fully traceable for compliance and A/B testing

Summary

SmartFlow Core enables iGaming businesses to:

Automate marketing without engineering tickets

Dynamically adapt to player behavior

Maintain platform stability and separation of concerns

This system is not just an exercise — it’s the blueprint for real-world marketing and ops automation.
